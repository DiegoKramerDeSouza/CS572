SetTimeout will be executed on Timers phase, schedules a script to be executed after a 
minimum threshold has elapsed. SetImmediate will be executed on check phase, will execute
a script when current poll phase completes, does not use queue of functions only checks the 
queue of I/O event handlers and execute when this queue is finished.
the execution order will vary depending on context which they are called. If SetImmediate is 
scheduled within a I/O cycle, it will be executed before any Timers phase, in this case, the 
SetImmediate will be executed before SetTimeout.

Process.nextTick() is not part of event loop, it is called and executed before event loop 
continues, that means it will be processed after the currrent operationis completed, regardless 
of the current phase of the event loop.
Process.nextTick() fires more immediately than setImmediate.
